That's the problematic we want to answer and for that we will use different models in order to determine the best accuracy_score.

in order to make our predictions we followed these steps :

# 1- Gather informations on the datasets provided 
# 2- Visualize the data in order to determine which columns can effect our prediction 
# 3- Determine which model we will use
# 4- Make the predictions and determine the accuracy-score
# 5- Feature Engineering
# 6- Try on other models
# 7- Find out which model is better
